# Capstone 2 Proposal - Dan Vo

##  **Instagram Clone**
<hr>

1. **What tech stack will you use for your final project? We recommend that you use React and Node for this project, however if you are extremely interested in becoming a Python developer you are welcome to use Python/Flask for this project.**

    React & Node

2. **Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your project? Or are you going to make an evenly focused full-stack application?** 

    I plan to create an evenly focused full-stack application. I want to create a clone of Instagram with features mimicking the actual application as much as possible along with having a similar UI with my own added touches. 

3. **Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?** 

    I will primarily be creating a website but will look towards tailoring for mobile once features are working smoothly. 

4. **What goal will your project be designed to achieve?** 

    Main feature of the application is to allow users to share photographs with followers and for users to be able to see a live feed of photos from users they themselves follow. 

    > I'd like to showcase my ability to understand the technology which goes into building a widely used app.

5. **What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?** 

    Users of all ages who are interested in sharing their creativity and exploring what others create through photography. 

6. **What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and populate it with data. If you are using a Python/Flask stack are required to create your own API.**

    I will be creating my own API for processing data. Data I plan on using include general user info, images, likes, comments, followers.

7. **In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not know everything in advance and that these details might change later).** 
   
    _Answer questions like the ones below, but feel free to add more information:_

    - _**What does your database schema look like?**_ 

        Refer to schema file.
    
    - _**What kinds of issues might you run into with your API? This is especially important if you are creating your own API, web scraping produces notoriously messy data.**_ 

        Making sure I structure my API correctly and avoid errors through testing. Need to figure out how I will store the images users post and how to associate likes/favorites. 

    - _**Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?**_ 

        User login info

    - _**What functionality will your app include?**_ 

        - Create an account to see a feed/image/profile
        - Post images 
        - Follow other users
        - Like others' images and see their likes on their profile
        - See number of likes, who liked it, and comments on an image
        - Comment on other users' images 
        - Edit/Delete profile

    - _**What will the user flow look like?**_ 

        - Users will be greated with a login/signup form if they are not yet logged in. 
        - Once logged in, users will be taken to the home page which will be a feed of images from users they follow. 
        - From the home page, they can comment and like these photos or they can click on the user's profile and see the images from there
        - Users can also navigate to their own profile where they can see their posts, number of followers/following, edit profile button, and liked images page. 


    - _**What features make your site more than a CRUD app? What are your stretch goals?**_

        Strech Goals include: 
        - Location tags for image posts
        - Save image feature (can privately see saved photos on user profile)
        - Allow users to create custom folders for images they save
        - Click/hover on image to enlarge image 
        - Add ability to like comments on posts
        - Posting image carousels (multiple images at once)
        - Hashtags
